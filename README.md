# Using satellite data to monitor urban green space

## 1. Introduction
In this activity, we will look at the use of satellite data to address United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 15.1, 15.5 and 15.9 through a mixture of learning material and experimentation with real data. This will take you about 1 hour to work through.

## 2. How to use this resource 
This learning resource is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). It brings together text, images and code, allowing us to try out techniques alongside the relevant information. I have used the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language to produce this but you don't need to know Python to use this resource.

Notebooks are made up of cells. A cell can either contain text (markdown) or code. A notebook can either be used *statically* (you can only view the contents) or *dynamically* (you can run, alter, re-run and interact with the Python code within the notebook). You can do many useful things with Jupyter Notebooks and [there is a useful demonstration Notebook here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb) that explains the different features.

If you are reading this information on the GitHub website or in another *static* format, you won't be able to use the interactive features. If you would like to interact with the experiments below, please [click this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/joe-fennell/eo-for-sdgs/blob/main/1_FirstSteps.ipynb) to open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colabs. This sometimes requires you to log in to a google account but once you have created an account and logged in, it is free to use. Alternatively, you can view a static version [here](https://github.com/joe-fennell/eo-for-sdgs/blob/main/1_FirstSteps.ipynb)

Once you have opened this activity in Google Colabs ([click this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/joe-fennell/eo-for-sdgs/blob/main/1_FirstSteps.ipynb)) If you would like to interact with this notebook in Google Colabs, it is important to run the entire notebook before continuing. Do this now by clicking `Runtime > Run all` in the menu above
